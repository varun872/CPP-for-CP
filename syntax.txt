The 4 lines in any C++ code
1. #include
- Adds a 'header file' to the code
- Header files contain various pre-defined functions that one can use in the code
- Shortcut which includes all the important header files automatically to the code

2. using namespace std
- Means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library

3. int main()
- Function
- Any code inside the curly brackets{} will be executed
- Always executed first

4. return 0
- Ends the main function

NOTE: Do not forget to add the closing curly bracket "}" to actually end the main function
